    Nearly half the U.S. population enjoys a tea beverage every day. The most common types of caffeinated teas are black, green and oolong and the popularity of each type varies geographically. In the US, black tea consumption far outweighs the other two types of tea. In contrast, in Asia, green tea is the more common variety; in Southern China, oolong tea tops the charts. 
    <span> 
    Black, green and oolong tea are made from the same plant. The unique flavor profiles for each of these teas are due to differences in how the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant are processed. Herbal teas, however, are not made from the same plant. These teas are products of the roots, leaves, flowers and other components from a variety of plants. Chamomile and peppermint are two popular herbal teas. Chamomile is made from the plantâ€™s flowers and peppermint from the leaves of a mint plant.
